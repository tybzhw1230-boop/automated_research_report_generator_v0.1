# Project Handoff

## Purpose

This file is the working handoff for future agent sessions on this repository.
Read it before making changes so the next session can resume with the same context.

## Repository Status

- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/tybzhw1230-boop/automated_research_report_generator_v0.1`
- Default branch: `main`
- The repository was created and pushed from this local project on 2026-04-02.
- The repository is currently intended to include the `pdf/` and `output/` directories because the user explicitly approved uploading those files.
- Sensitive/local-only items still ignored: `.env`, `.venv/`, `.cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `.recycle`, `logs/`, `*.tmp`

## Session Transcript Summary

This is a compact, agent-readable transcript of the work completed in this terminal session.

1. User request: publish this project to GitHub.
   Result: checked the workspace and found that the directory was not yet a Git repository. `gh` CLI was not installed.

2. Initial repository review:
   Result: confirmed `.env` was already ignored. Reviewed project files and found generated caches, PDFs, and output reports in the workspace.

3. Initial publish safety step:
   Result: tightened `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally committing cache and local environment files.

4. User clarification:
   User said commands were allowed to run and all project files could be uploaded.
   Result: updated `.gitignore` so `pdf/` and `output/` would be versioned instead of ignored.

5. Git initialization:
   Result: cleaned up a failed `.git` initialization attempt, then initialized a new Git repository with branch `main`.

6. First commit:
   Result: staged the project and created the initial commit with message `Initial project import`.

7. GitHub authentication:
   Result: GitHub CLI was unavailable, so authentication was handled through Git Credential Manager. The user later completed login manually.

8. Remote repository creation and push:
   Result: created GitHub repository `tybzhw1230-boop/automated_research_report_generator_v0.1`, configured `origin`, and pushed `main`.

9. Current user request:
   User asked to convert the conversation content into an agent-readable file and upload it to GitHub so work can continue after switching terminals.
   Result: this file was created, and `AGENTS.md` was updated to point future agents here.

## Important Decisions From This Session

- `pdf/` and `output/` are intentionally tracked in Git for this repository.
- `.env` must remain untracked.
- The current GitHub owner/account used for publishing is `tybzhw1230-boop`.
- The repository was created as a public GitHub repository.
- No source-code behavior changes were made during the publish step; the main changes were Git setup, repository creation, and this handoff documentation.

## Current Working State

- Local branch `main` tracks `origin/main`.
- The project root contains a CrewAI-based research report generator.
- Key files for future work:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `README.md`
  - `src/automated_research_report_generator_v0_1/`

## Recommended Resume Checklist

When a future agent continues work, it should:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read this file.
3. Check `git status --short --branch`.
4. Review `README.md` and `pyproject.toml`.
5. If modifying CrewAI code, follow the live-version and docs checks required by `AGENTS.md`.

## Notes For Future Sessions

- If the user asks to keep extending this memory, append new session summaries here instead of creating multiple handoff files.
- If repository visibility should be private instead of public, that still needs to be changed on GitHub.
